What is Badcoin? 
----------------
Badcoin is multichain made from five blockchain algorithms; 
* sha
* scrypt
* groestl
* skein 
* yescrypt

We set up BADCOIN to be mineable by anyone with a computer that can connect to the internet. Even old school Pentiums from back in the day!

We wanted to make mining crypto inclusive and not exclusive for only a few select people with large mining operations. And in fact, your old, bad computer can get larger rewards by mining!

The Badcoin white paper will be available at http://badcryptopodcast.com

Badcoin is a peer-to-peer multichain built on 5 blockchain protocols. This allows the transfer of assets from one party to another cheaper, faster, safer, and sexier than others.

Anyone can mine it on any computer.  Itâ€™s fair for all!

By supporting BADCOIN, you help people all over the world in developing countries mine cryptocurrencies the same as the most privileged person in the developed countries.  Badcoin levels the playing field.

Badcoin History
---------------
In August of 2017, Joel figured out that we could use Bitshares and create a coin that we could use to give away to our growing Bad Crypto Podcast community.

Over the next 6 months, they gave away over 2 billion BADCOIN on the Bitshares platform to their fans.  And now, you can finally mine BADCOIN!

Mining Solutions
----------------
Travis realized there was a big problem with Bitcoin as a mining protocol.  It was just too hard to mine for everyday people.

Well, not anymore.  Everyone can mine BADCOIN fairly. There is no Jihan Wu with a huge-ass mining farm, because BADCOIN de-incentivizes such greedy behavior.  Anyone can mine BAD!

Crypto Investments
------------------
The BADCOIN team makes no financial investment advice about BADCOIN as an investment opportunity.  Our goal is to create the most efficient cryptocurrency blockchain in the world.

Our goal is to allow anyone in the world the opportunity to mine and earn value. The price is irrelevant.
